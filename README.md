## Contributing Rules

We welcome contributions to the **Ecommerce** project!
Please follow these rules to maintain consistency and ensure a smooth workflow:

---

### 1. Always Pull Before Starting
- Pull the latest changes from the `main` branch before starting any new work:
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

---

### 2. Create a New Branch for Each Feature
- Use the following naming convention for branches:  
  ```
  <your-Name><FeatureName>
  Example:
  - For "Rakshya Niraula" formating the code:
    ```
    rakshyaFormat
    

---

### 3. Resolve Conflicts Locally
- Handle any merge conflicts on your local machine rather than on GitHub's web interface.

---

### 4. Never Commit Directly to `main`
- The `main` branch is protected. Always work on a separate branch and submit a pull request (PR) for review.

---






### 8. Submit a Pull Request
- Submit a PR to the `main` branch with a clear title and description of your changes.
- Tag a team member for review.

---

By following these rules, we can ensure that our project stays clean, efficient, and collaborative. Thank you for contributing! 😊
